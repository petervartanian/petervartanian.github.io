# Experience (as timeline)

<div class="pv-cv-top">
  <p class="pv-cv-lede">
    A chronological spine of institutions, shops, and laboratories I have inhabited—what I built, what I learned to measure,
    and the kinds of problems that refused to stay solved.

  <div class="pv-tl-year">2025–</div>

  <div class="pv-tl-item">
    <div class="pv-tl-when">Oct 2025 – Present</div>
    <h2 class="pv-tl-place">GéoPoly Global</h2>
    <p class="pv-tl-story">
      I am assembling a small research-and-consulting practice that treats geo‑technology as a discipline of constraints:
      where hardware, code, law, and institutions collide, and where “strategy” is mostly the art of choosing what must be made legible.
      The work looks like memos, models, and experimental instruments—tools for seeing second‑order effects before they become first‑order crises.
    </p>
  </div>

  <div class="pv-tl-item">
    <div class="pv-tl-when">Aug 2025</div>
    <h2 class="pv-tl-place">Hoover Institution, Stanford University</h2>
    <p class="pv-tl-story">
      A compressed policy sprint: taking a live question, forcing it into a tractable frame, and producing analysis that can survive contact
      with people who actually have to decide. The craft here is not persuasion; it is compression—turning sprawling uncertainty into a decision‑shaped object.
    </p>
  </div>

  <div class="pv-tl-item">
    <div class="pv-tl-when">Jun 2025 – Aug 2025</div>
    <h2 class="pv-tl-place">Nuclear Threat Initiative</h2>
    <p class="pv-tl-story">
      Working at the seam where emerging technology meets governance: translating AI risk rhetoric into actionable questions about incentives,
      oversight, and failure modes. The aim is less “AI safety” as slogan than safety as institutional design—what gets audited, by whom, and with what authority.
    </p>
  </div>

  <div class="pv-tl-item">
    <div class="pv-tl-when">Jan 2025 – May 2025</div>
    <h2 class="pv-tl-place">Office of Los Angeles Mayor Karen Bass</h2>
    <p class="pv-tl-story">
      Custom research for municipal diplomacy: mapping the international surface area of a city—trade, partnerships, diaspora politics, and the quiet bureaucracy
      that turns symbolic relationships into real operational capacity. The work is a mix of briefing, synthesis, and legibility: making the outside world usable from City Hall.
    </p>
  </div>

  <div class="pv-tl-item">
    <div class="pv-tl-when">Jan 2025 – May 2025</div>
    <h2 class="pv-tl-place">The Program on Negotiation</h2>
    <p class="pv-tl-story">
      Studying bargaining not as etiquette but as infrastructure: how commitments are made credible, how information becomes leverage, and how institutions
      scaffold “voluntary” agreement. The deliverable is an applied vocabulary for conflict that does not flatter anyone.
    </p>
  </div>

  <div class="pv-tl-year">2024</div>

  <div class="pv-tl-item">
    <div class="pv-tl-when">Dec 2024 – Jan 2025</div>
    <h2 class="pv-tl-place">OECD Observatory of Public Sector Innovation</h2>
    <p class="pv-tl-story">
      Short consultancy at the edge of the state’s R&amp;D function: scanning how governments experiment, what they measure, and what they call “innovation”
      when the incentives are misaligned. Public value is the metric; bureaucracy is the medium.
    </p>
  </div>

  <div class="pv-tl-item">
    <div class="pv-tl-when">Aug 2024 – Dec 2024</div>
    <h2 class="pv-tl-place">United Nations</h2>
    <p class="pv-tl-story">
      Policy advising and speechwriting inside an institution that speaks in ritual while operating through procedure.
      I learned to treat agendas, drafts, and votes as a kind of machinery—and to read the geometry of power in the edits people fight for and the clauses they quietly abandon.
    </p>
  </div>

  <div class="pv-tl-item">
    <div class="pv-tl-when">May 2024 – Aug 2024</div>
    <h2 class="pv-tl-place">Pacific Life</h2>
    <p class="pv-tl-story">
      A public‑policy fellowship in a private institution: tracing how regulation, capital allocation, and macro risk travel through firms
      that are not “political” until they are forced to be. The lesson: governance often hides in balance sheets.
    </p>
  </div>

  <div class="pv-tl-item">
    <div class="pv-tl-when">Jan 2024 – May 2024</div>
    <h2 class="pv-tl-place">UN Human Rights Council Investigative Bodies</h2>
    <p class="pv-tl-story">
      Research work at the forensic end of international law: building evidentiary narratives that are careful enough to be used and restrained enough to be trusted.
      The focus is method—how claims become defensible, and how documentation survives hostile scrutiny.
    </p>
  </div>

  <div class="pv-tl-item">
    <div class="pv-tl-when">Jan 2024 – Jan 2025</div>
    <h2 class="pv-tl-place">Verum Legalis</h2>
    <p class="pv-tl-story">
      I founded and edited a law‑review / multimedia platform as an experiment in public legal reasoning:
      taking doctrine seriously while refusing to let it remain sealed inside specialist prose.
      The work was editorial architecture—standards, cadence, and a pipeline that makes thinking publishable.
    </p>
  </div>

  <div class="pv-tl-item">
    <div class="pv-tl-when">Jan 2024 – May 2025</div>
    <h2 class="pv-tl-place">Stealth Startup (AI + EdTech)</h2>
    <p class="pv-tl-story">
      Co‑building an education product with AI in the loop, where the real design problem is not model capability but pedagogy:
      feedback that teaches instead of merely scoring, and systems that resist becoming automated vanity.
      I treat the classroom as a complex system—and “learning outcomes” as something you have to earn, not declare.
    </p>
  </div>

  <div class="pv-tl-year">2023</div>

  <div class="pv-tl-item">
    <div class="pv-tl-when">Dec 2023 – May 2025</div>
    <h2 class="pv-tl-place">Ford Foundation</h2>
    <p class="pv-tl-story">
      A research fellowship that sharpened my taste for work that is both rigorous and socially legible.
      The core practice: choosing a question that matters, building the evidence, and writing in a way that can be used by people who are not obligated to agree with you.
    </p>
  </div>

  <div class="pv-tl-item">
    <div class="pv-tl-when">Jan 2023 – May 2025</div>
    <h2 class="pv-tl-place">John Parke Young Initiative on the Global Political Economy</h2>
    <p class="pv-tl-story">
      Program management as statecraft in miniature: recruiting speakers, building research programming, and turning institutional ambition into schedules, budgets, and deliverables.
      I learned that “ideas” become real only when someone does operations.
    </p>
  </div>

  <div class="pv-tl-item">
    <div class="pv-tl-when">May 2023 – Aug 2023</div>
    <h2 class="pv-tl-place">Lemkin Institute for Genocide Prevention</h2>
    <p class="pv-tl-story">
      Politico‑legal analysis in the domain where words are expensive: early warning, legal framing, and the uncomfortable task of naming patterns before they become history.
      Precision is ethical here; it is also strategic.
    </p>
  </div>

  <div class="pv-tl-item">
    <div class="pv-tl-when">Aug 2023 – May 2024</div>
    <h2 class="pv-tl-place">Bureau of Industry and Security (U.S. Department of Commerce)</h2>
    <p class="pv-tl-story">
      Work at the policy‑hardware interface: export controls, critical technologies, and the bureaucratic levers that shape global supply chains.
      The real object of study is not “trade,” but constraint—how states create it, administer it, and sometimes pretend they did not.
    </p>
  </div>

  <div class="pv-tl-year">2022</div>

  <div class="pv-tl-item">
    <div class="pv-tl-when">Aug 2022 – May 2025</div>
    <h2 class="pv-tl-place">Occidental College Blyth Fund</h2>
    <p class="pv-tl-story">
      Ad‑hoc consulting in a setting that forces seriousness: due diligence, argumentation, and the habit of asking
      “what would have to be true for this to work?” before believing the story.
    </p>
  </div>

  <div class="pv-tl-item">
    <div class="pv-tl-when">Aug 2022 – May 2024</div>
    <h2 class="pv-tl-place">McKinnon Center for Global Affairs</h2>
    <p class="pv-tl-story">
      Special‑assistant work at the intersection of scholarship and public engagement:
      preparing briefings, supporting programming, and learning how institutions translate expertise into public-facing action.
      The quiet skill is timing—getting the right material in front of people when it can still change something.
    </p>
  </div>

  <div class="pv-tl-item">
    <div class="pv-tl-when">Oct 2022 – Dec 2022</div>
    <h2 class="pv-tl-place">Geneva Graduate Institute</h2>
    <p class="pv-tl-story">
      A short immersion in social science for lawyers: methods, data, and the discipline of making claims that can be tested.
      It sharpened my instinct to treat legal argument as a kind of model—explicit assumptions, explicit limits.
    </p>
  </div>

  <div class="pv-tl-item">
    <div class="pv-tl-when">May 2022 – Aug 2022</div>
    <h2 class="pv-tl-place">European Forum Alpbach</h2>
    <p class="pv-tl-story">
      Event operations inside a traveling miniature of Europe: logistics, program flow, and the backstage labor that makes “dialogue” possible.
      I learned how convening is itself a technology of power.
    </p>
  </div>

  <div class="pv-tl-item">
    <div class="pv-tl-when">Dec 2022 – Jan 2023</div>
    <h2 class="pv-tl-place">Wolf Theiss</h2>
    <p class="pv-tl-story">
      A Vienna stint in the legal‑office ecosystem: research, client‑facing coordination, and the practical discipline of being useful under time pressure.
      Law is not just doctrine; it is also workflow.
    </p>
  </div>

  <div class="pv-tl-year">2021</div>

  <div class="pv-tl-item">
    <div class="pv-tl-when">Aug 2021 – May 2025</div>
    <h2 class="pv-tl-place">Occidental College</h2>
    <p class="pv-tl-story">
      Four years of research, teaching, leadership, and analysis—less a single “role” than a stack of responsibilities.
      I treated the campus as a sandbox for institution‑building: running programs, teaching languages, doing honors‑level research,
      and learning which kinds of coordination create durable communities rather than mere events.
    </p>
  </div>

  <div class="pv-tl-item">
    <div class="pv-tl-when">Dec 2021 – Jan 2022</div>
    <h2 class="pv-tl-place">Wolf Theiss</h2>
    <p class="pv-tl-story">
      A winter legal + business internship—learning how firms metabolize ambiguity:
      where the question is rarely “what is true?” and more often “what can be defended, documented, and delivered on time?”
    </p>
  </div>

  <div class="pv-tl-year">2020</div>

  <div class="pv-tl-item">
    <div class="pv-tl-when">Oct 2020 – Mar 2021</div>
    <h2 class="pv-tl-place">U.S. Department of State (ECA)</h2>
    <p class="pv-tl-story">
      Inside exchange‑program bureaucracy—the soft‑power engine room: tracking outcomes, supporting visiting delegations, and learning
      how “people‑to‑people” diplomacy becomes a spreadsheet, a process, and a set of incentives.
    </p>
  </div>

  <div class="pv-tl-item">
    <div class="pv-tl-when">Jul 2020 – Sep 2020</div>
    <h2 class="pv-tl-place">SWAROVSKI OPTIK</h2>
    <p class="pv-tl-story">
      Advanced optics / R&amp;D work where measurement is the culture: tolerances, tests, and the stubborn physicality that keeps theory honest.
      I learned to respect the world of constraints that sits beneath every “innovation” narrative.
    </p>
  </div>

  <div class="pv-tl-year">2018</div>

  <div class="pv-tl-item">
    <div class="pv-tl-when">Feb 2018 – Jun 2020</div>
    <h2 class="pv-tl-place">HUN‑REN Rényi Institute of Mathematics</h2>
    <p class="pv-tl-story">
      Research assistance in a place that treats rigor as a moral category.
      The work trained the muscle that still matters most to me: the willingness to say “I don’t know” until the proof—or the evidence—forces the claim.
    </p>
