# Curriculum Vitæ

My complete academic and professional history is available [here](/404.md).

The document includes what one would expect: education, appointments, publications, presentations, teaching, service.

For inquiries about ongoing work or potential collaboration, the [contact](/contact) page is more useful than the CV.
