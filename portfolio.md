# Portfolio

The **Projects** page is a laboratory: prototypes, instruments, unfinished machinery. This page is the **cabinet**: the few things that are finished enough to be handled by strangers.

A rule of inclusion: each entry should survive without backstory. If it needs me standing over your shoulder to narrate it, it belongs in **Projects**.

<div class="pv-card-grid">

<div class="pv-card">

## Briefs & white papers

Writing meant to be cited. The unit of value is a claim that can be checked.

<ul>
  <li><em>(slot)</em> A short note on export-control surface area and the places enforcement actually touches.</li>
  <li><em>(slot)</em> A compliance reading of a regulation as if it were an adversary’s playbook.</li>
</ul>

</div>

<div class="pv-card">

## Trackers & datasets

Ledgers, maps, and structured memory: the infrastructure that makes argument cheaper.

<ul>
  <li><em>(slot)</em> A living table of dual-use regimes across jurisdictions, with citations and diffs.</li>
  <li><em>(slot)</em> A network view of chokepoints: where flow becomes leverage.</li>
</ul>

</div>

<div class="pv-card">

## Tools & workflows

Small instruments: scripts, templates, and routines that turn messy sources into usable structure.

<ul>
  <li><em>(slot)</em> A scraper + dashboard pipeline that keeps a policy surface in view.</li>
  <li><em>(slot)</em> A repeatable “scenario distillery” for turning anxiety into parameters.</li>
</ul>

</div>

If you want the cabinet to feel less like placeholders and more like a catalog, give each entry four lines: **context**, **method**, **artifact**, **what changed**.
