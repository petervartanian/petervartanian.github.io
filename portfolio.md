# Portfolio

A cabinet, not a diary.

<div class="pv-work-grid" role="list">

  <div class="pv-work-card" role="listitem">

    <h2 class="pv-work-title">The STELE</h2>
    <p class="pv-work-subtitle">Sovereign Testbed for Evaluating Language‑model Externalities</p>
    <p class="pv-work-body">
      Building a sovereign‑grade sandbox for asking the impolite questions that modern language systems
      prefer you not ask: who bears the externalities, where they concentrate, and which “safety”
      stories collapse under contact with real institutions. The goal is not a single model verdict;
      it is a repeatable instrument—portable across agencies, sectors, and regimes of accountability.

    <h2 class="pv-work-title">The Lone Star Paradigm</h2>
    <p class="pv-work-subtitle">A Texan blueprint for U.S. energy leadership in the twenty‑first century</p>
    <p class="pv-work-body">
      An argument about energy not as commodity but as governance substrate—where production, permitting,
      and infrastructure become instruments of statecraft, and where “abundance” is a policy choice with
      downstream geopolitical consequences.

    </div>
    <h2 class="pv-work-title">EU (Legal) Statecraft in an Age of Coercion</h2>
    <p class="pv-work-subtitle">Law as leverage; compliance as battlefield geometry</p>
    <p class="pv-work-body">
      A study of how law becomes a coercive instrument without ever announcing itself as such—export controls,
      market access, standards, and procedural choke points composing an arsenal that looks like paperwork until
      it starts deciding outcomes.

    <h2 class="pv-work-title">Allied Mettle, Allied Metals</h2>
    <p class="pv-work-subtitle">A market‑based playbook for critical‑mineral supply chains</p>
    <p class="pv-work-body">
      A practical memorandum on supply chains as alliance architecture: incentives, contracts, and industrial policy
      as the boring levers that keep strategy from becoming mere rhetoric.
