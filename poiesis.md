# Poiesis

A small cabinet of things I have built, written, and made operational. I prefer work that behaves like an instrument: it clarifies stakes, exposes constraints, and survives contact with institutions.

## Instruments

### The STELE: Sovereign Testbed for Evaluating Language-model Externalities

<span class="pv-meta">Sep 2025 — Present</span>

A testbed for asking a question most people postpone until consequences arrive: what does a deployed language system do to the jurisdiction that adopts it? The emphasis is on externalities: failure modes, incentive gradients, procedural drift, and the quiet ways an organization begins to speak with a voice it did not author.

### Verum Legalis

<span class="pv-meta">Jan 2024 — Jan 2025</span>

A law-review and multimedia platform built as a countermeasure against vapid certainty: an editorial structure for arguments that can survive contact with statutes, treaties, budgets, and the moral weather of the moment.

### STOXY

<span class="pv-meta">Aug 2021 — May 2025</span>

Students teaching students, at scale: pedagogy as infrastructure. The point was continuity, a repeatable way to transfer craft, languages, and methods across cohorts without losing the thread.

## Selected artifacts

- **The Lone Star Paradigm** — a policy argument built like a power-system diagram: where resilience is engineered, where it is performed, and where it quietly leaks. [Read](https://nationalinterest.org/blog/energy-world/u-s-energy-leadership-in-the-21st-century)

- **EU (Legal) Statecraft in an Age of Coercion** — a study of law as leverage: instruments, thresholds, and the choreography by which norms become policy under pressure. [Read](https://scholarship.claremont.edu/urceu/vol2025/iss1/14/)

- **Index Cards** — an ongoing compression exercise: large problems reduced to cards that can be shuffled, re-ordered, and re-argued without losing the thread.

  > Jurisdiction is not a border; it is a set of verbs.
  >
  > A model is a confession about what you chose not to measure.
  >
  > Most “policy” fails because it mistakes the map for the maintenance schedule.
