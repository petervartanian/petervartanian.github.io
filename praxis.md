# Praxis

A working chronology, oriented toward what I was actually doing: the institutional setting, the task, and the learned constraint.

<div class="pv-timeline">
  <div class="pv-entry">
    <div class="pv-entry-head">
      <div class="pv-fn">Research + Consulting</div>
      <div class="pv-place">GéoPoly Global</div>
      <div class="pv-dates">Oct 2025 — Present</div>
    </div>
    <p>Working at the seam where geopolitics becomes engineering: making hard questions legible, mapping incentives to infrastructure, and turning strategy into tasks that can survive contact with procurement, budgets, and implementation.</p>
  </div>

    <div class="pv-entry-head">
      <div class="pv-fn">Pilot Consulting | FTZ 49 + Innovation Hub</div>
      <div class="pv-place">The Port Authority of New York &amp; New Jersey</div>
      <div class="pv-dates">Sep 2025 — Oct 2025</div>
    </div>
    <p>A short, concentrated pass through the machinery of ports: free-trade zones, compliance, and the logistics that quietly decide which ideas actually scale. The work was less “innovation” as branding and more innovation as frictions removed.</p>
  </div>

      <div class="pv-fn">W. Kurt Hauser Family Scholarship | HISPBC</div>

      <div class="pv-dates">Aug 2025</div>
    </div>
    <p>A brief residency in a policy engine-room: reading, writing, and pressure-testing arguments against the kinds of questions that do not care about your rhetoric.</p>
  </div>

      <div class="pv-dates">Jun 2025 — Aug 2025</div>
    </div>
    <p>Researching how emerging tech meets high-stakes governance: where safety becomes operational, where accountability hides, and how institutions can be made to learn faster than the systems they are meant to oversee.</p>
  </div>

      <div class="pv-dates">Jan 2025 — May 2025</div>
    </div>
    <p>Producing fast, bespoke analysis for a city that is also an actor: international linkages, institutional constraints, and the practical politics of moving something from memo to meeting to municipal reality.</p>
  </div>

    </div>
    <p>Working inside the grammar of multilateralism: drafting, advising, and tracking the life of language as it passes through committees, coalitions, and the slow alchemy from text to posture to action.</p>
