# Projects

What follows will become a catalogue of instruments rather than products. Most will be small: a model, a visualization, a structured exercise, a way of asking a question that makes it harder to lie to oneself.

For now, only headings:

- Experiments that turn vague anxieties into concrete scenarios.  
- Sketches that treat maps, networks, and ledgers as different views of the same underlying machinery.  
- Exercises in reading institutions not by their slogans but by the failures they quietly prepare for.

As these pieces harden into something public, each entry here will gain a name, a short description, and a link. Until then, this page is a promise that the files will come first and the interpretations later.
