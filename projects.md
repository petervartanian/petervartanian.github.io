# Projects

A catalogue of instruments rather than monuments.

<ol type="i" class="pv-roman">
  <li>Experiments that convert vague anxieties into concrete scenarios (☺︎);</li>
  <li>Sketches that treat maps, networks, and ledgers as different views of the same underlying machinery;</li>
  <li>Readings of institutions not by their slogans but by the failures for which they quietly prepare.</li>
</ol>

Each entry will appear here with a name, a short description, and a link—once it can stand on its own without apology.
