These are instruments rather than products: models, prototypes, and institutions engineered into legible shape.

## The STELE: Sovereign Testbed for Evaluating Language-model Externalities

<span class="pv-meta">Sep 2025 — Present</span>

A testbed for asking a question that most people dodge until the consequences arrive: what does a deployed language system do to the jurisdiction that adopts it? The emphasis is not on capability theater, but on externalities — failure modes, incentive gradients, procedural drift, and the quiet ways an organization begins to speak with a voice it did not author.

## Verum Legalis

<span class="pv-meta">Jan 2024 — Jan 2025</span>

A law-review and multimedia platform built as a countermeasure against vapid certainty: an editorial structure for arguments that can survive contact with statutes, treaties, budgets, and the moral weather of the moment.

## STOXY

<span class="pv-meta">Aug 2021 — May 2025</span>

Students teaching students, at scale — an experiment in pedagogy as infrastructure. The point was not charisma, but continuity: a repeatable way to transfer craft, languages, and methods across cohorts without losing the thread.
