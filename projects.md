# Projects

If you want finished artifacts rather than the lab notebook, see the **[portfolio](/portfolio)**.

What follows will become a catalogue of instruments rather than products. Most will be small: a model, a visualization, a structured exercise, a way of asking a question that makes it harder to lie to oneself.

For now, only headings:

<ol type="i">
  <li>Experiments that convert vague anxieties into concrete scenarios (☺︎);</li>
  <li>Sketches that treat maps, networks, and ledgers as different views of the same underlying machinery;</li>
  <li>Readings of institutions not by their slogans but by the failures for which they quietly prepare;</li>
</ol>

As these pieces harden into something public, each entry here will gain a name, a short description, and a link.

Until then, this page is a promise that the files will come first and the interpretations later.
