# Projects

What follows will become a catalogue of instruments rather than products. Most will be small: a model, a visualization, a structured exercise, a way of asking a question that makes it harder to lie to oneself.

For now, only headings:

(<u>i</u>) experiments that convert vague anxieties into concrete scenarios (:]);
(<u>ii</u>) sketches that treat maps, networks, and ledgers as different views of the same underlying machinery;
(<u>iii</u>) readings of institutions not by their slogans but by the failures for which they quietly prepare.

As these pieces harden into something public, each entry here will gain a name, a short description, and a link.

Until then, this page is a promise that the files will come first and the interpretations later.
