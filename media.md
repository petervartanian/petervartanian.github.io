# Media

I treat the public record as a secondary source: useful, partial, and always written for someone else. Still, there are a few fragments worth indexing.

## Publications

- *The Lone Star Paradigm: A Texan Blueprint for U.S. Energy Leadership in the Twenty-First Century* — <span class="pv-meta">The National Interest · Feb 2025</span>
- *EU (Legal) Statecraft in an Age of Coercion* — <span class="pv-meta">Claremont-UC Undergraduate Research Conference Journal on the European Union · Oct 2025</span>
- *Allied Mettle, Allied Metals: A Market-Based Playbook for Critical-Mineral Supply Chains* — <span class="pv-meta">The Hoover Institution on War, Revolution, and Peace · 2025</span>

## Signals

I do not keep a press roll. If something about my work is circulating and you want the source, the fastest path is to ask directly.
