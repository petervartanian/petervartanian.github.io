# Media

This page will eventually collect fragments of the public record: profiles, interviews, podcasts, and other attempts by third parties to make sense of what I do.

For now, it is empty.

Items will appear here when they exist and when they add more signal than noise. The absence of content indicates either that such coverage has not occurred or that existing coverage has not warranted inclusion.

If you are a journalist or editor seeking comment, refer to the [contact](/contact) page. Provide context on what you are writing about, who you are writing for, and what specific expertise you are seeking. Generic requests for "expert commentary" will not receive replies.
