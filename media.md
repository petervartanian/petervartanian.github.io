# Media

This page will eventually collect fragments of the public record: profiles, interviews, podcasts, and other attempts by third parties to make sense of what I do.

For now, it is empty.

Items will appear here when they exist and when they add more signal than noise.

<div class="pv-callout">
  This page is intentionally sparse. When an item appears here, it will have a short note on <em>why it matters</em> (not just a link).
</div>
