# Peter H. Vartanian

Greetings!

I am a pertinacious scholar from an agrarian hamlet tucked into the stone and pasture of the Tyrolean Alps: [Weng](https://mapcarta.com/N1938447213). It is neither (<u>a</u>) a place that tends to produce theorists nor (<u>b</u>) one that is conspicuous enough to not miss if one blinked on the wrong bend in the road. Indeed, the scale there was human and weather-sized; mountains set the boundary conditions; and, seasons explained more than any market did.

Since self-transplanting to the manifold of U.S. urban life, my world has arrived in files, cables, contracts, rumors, maps, datasets, and half-remembered conversations on trains. I try to hold them together long enough to see a pattern and then let the pattern fracture again, so that it does not become an idol. The work, then, is less a career than a flexuous attempt to look at power without flattery and at fragility without romance.

This site is only a small room in that larger project: It will — in the _longue durée_ — collect notes, diagrams, thought-experiments, and other working artefacts: things that are not yet polished enough for formal publication but too stubborn to stay in a private notebook.

If something here is unfinished, that is a feature moreso than a defect.

It means... that the question is still alive.
