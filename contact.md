# Contact

For now, the most reliable channels are the professional ones:

- **LinkedIn:** {% if site.linkedin_url %}[{{ site.linkedin_url }}]({{ site.linkedin_url }}){% else %}(add `linkedin_url` in `_config.yml`){% endif %}
- **GitHub:** [https://github.com/{{ site.github_username }}](https://github.com/{{ site.github_username }})

If you genuinely need email, it is published for now as: **{{ site.author.email }}**.
