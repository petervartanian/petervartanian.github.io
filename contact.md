# Contact

A public “contact form” is easy; a good contact channel is harder.

If you are reaching out — the thought of which elates me — I would rather it land somewhere I can actually answer with care, not just expediency:

1. **Email:** [peter.vartanian@icloud.com](mailto:peter.vartanian@icloud.com)
2. **Phone:** [+1 (747) 786-9132](tel:+17477869132)
3. **LinkedIn:** [https://www.linkedin.com/in/petervartanian/](https://www.linkedin.com/in/petervartanian/)
4. **GitHub:** [https://github.com/petervartanian](https://github.com/petervartanian)
5. **ORCID:** [https://orcid.org/0009-0009-8538-5811](https://orcid.org/0009-0009-8538-5811)
