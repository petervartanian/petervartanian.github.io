# Contact

A public “contact form” is easy; a good contact channel is harder.

If you’re reaching out — which elates me — I would rather it land somewhere I can actually answer with care, not just expediency:

1. **Email:** [peter.vartanian@icloud.com](mailto:peter.vartanian@icloud.com)
2. **Phone:** +1 (747) 786-9132
3. **LinkedIn:** https://www.linkedin.com/in/petervartanian/
4. **GitHub:** https://github.com/petervartanian
